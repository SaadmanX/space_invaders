press a to go left
press d to go right
press s to shoot


there wil always be 6 descending opponents on the screen

if opponent descends below player, game over

for some reason, u cant keep holding a key for player to shoot or move continuesly, u have to tap key over and over again. opeining .py file on an ide might help that issue. 

Game is still very bad and rough and other things like opponent bullets and more opponents and bosses will be added after more research.\
